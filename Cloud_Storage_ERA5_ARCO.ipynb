This is a great example of public ARCO data, and while it represents a large amount of work (ERA5 is notoriously difficult to download and process), I hope this will convince you of the downstream benefits of work like this and hopefully encourage you to [ingest]() other relevant datasets into the LEAP-Data Library. \n",
