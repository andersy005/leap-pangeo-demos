    "- **Data**: [Cloud Storage Buckets](https://leap-stc.github.io/leap-pangeo/jupyterhub.html#leap-pangeo-buckets) enable researchers to store and share data within LEAP (and soon with the entire world). We either produce, transform, or link to Analysis-Ready Cloud-Optimized (ARCO) data within LEAP.\n",
    "- **Compute**: We like working with data with JupyterLab/Notebooks as the interface, and scalable compute backed by dask running on Kubernetes. But you can bring your own compute as you like! Or just take a look at the data with the Dataviewer.\n",
    "    - All our compute and data access is based on the same central cloud storage location, and clearly documented standards/interfaces.\n",
    "- **Discovery**: The different [types of data](https://leap-stc.github.io/policies/data_policy.html#types-of-data-used-at-leap) are collected in our [LEAP Data Catalog](https://catalog.leap.carbonplan.org/) (Final URL still pending).\n",

    "- Full reproducibility: As long as you have the version of the software environment and version controlled code, you will be able to reproduce your results perfectly every time.\n",
    "- Easy collaboration within and outside LEAP. [Hermans et al. 2024](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023EF004188?af=R) was the product of cross atlantic collaboration that felt just like being in the same city!\n",
    "- Easier support: Just send a gist, snippet, repository to the [Data and Compute Team]() and we can easily debug, suggest fixes, and get scientists back to what matters.\n",
    "- Teach on the same data, environments as you do research\n",
